# league_login
An automatic login menu for League of Legends.
Once launched, it will attempt to launch league of legends if the process isnt already running.
Thereafter you can Login, Add or Remove users from the local database, Refresh rankings, or Exit.
The accounts will be displayed with their Solo/DuoQ ranking besides their names.
That way the user knows exactly what rank the account is before signing in.

TLDR; This tool is for players who wants a faster login experience, or someone who has a lot of accounts.

NOTE! To use the refresh ranking menu you'll need a developer api from https://developer.riotgames.com/
Once you got an API, try refreshing and paste in the API key in the required field.
